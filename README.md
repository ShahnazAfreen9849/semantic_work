 Refactor: HTML, CSS, and Git

Description:

Marketing agency has existing website which needs modification.The Horiseon website is organized into three main sections, including a banner and a right sidebar with a navigational header. Semantic elements have been used to clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and developer. Alternative text attributes have been added to provide information about images in case a user cannot view them. The code refactoring process has been completed without altering the external behavior of the website.

Installation: N/A

Refactoring:

• Wrapped the main content using the main element and changed the class .content to main section and .benefits to aside element for better semantic meaning

• Removed duplicated code

•Added the HTML more semantic, reducing code duplication and keeping the codebase clean and concise. It also makes it easier to target each article with CSS.

Usage: To access various parts of the webpage, utilize the navigation panel located at the top right corner. To discover other content on the page, simply scroll either upwards or downwards.
